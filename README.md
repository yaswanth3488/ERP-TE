🚑 Emergency Room Performance and Triage Efficiency
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and improve Emergency Room (ER) performance and triage efficiency using a structured, real-world dataset. By focusing on patient flow, waiting times, triage response, and satisfaction levels, the analysis offers actionable insights that help hospital management make data-driven decisions to enhance patient care and operational efficiency.

🎯 Objective
Understand key performance indicators (KPIs) such as ER wait time, triage efficiency, doctor workload, and patient satisfaction

Identify bottlenecks in the emergency care process

Provide recommendations to reduce waiting times and improve critical patient treatment response

Showcase data analysis, dashboarding, and storytelling skills using Microsoft Excel

📊 Dataset Details
📁 File: ER_Visits_Refined.csv

📌 Size: 410,000+ rows

🧩 Structure: One single table with essential columns:

Visit ID, Arrival Time, Triage Level, Wait Time

Patient Age, Gender, Chronic Conditions

Insurance Status, Doctor Experience, Disposition

Satisfaction Score, Total ER Stay Time, and more

🛠️ Dataset was custom generated to simulate realistic ER scenarios such as peak hours, severity-based delays, and patient outcomes.

💡 Key Insights
⏳ Triage Level 1 (Critical) patients waited an average of 18 minutes; 65% treated within 15 mins.

⚠️ Non-Urgent patients waited 3x longer than Critical patients—indicating a need for alternate care pathways.

👨‍⚕️ Senior doctors handled most Critical cases—showing effective staff allocation.

📉 Satisfaction dropped sharply when wait times exceeded 120 minutes—justifying staffing adjustments during peak hours.

🧠 Recommendations for Hospital Management
Deploy additional staff during peak hours (e.g., 6–9 PM on weekends)

Introduce a fast-track line for non-urgent cases to reduce total ER burden

Set a Triage Efficiency target and monitor % of critical cases treated under 15 mins

Track Satisfaction Scores and correlate with wait time patterns
