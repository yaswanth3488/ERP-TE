# 🏥 Optimizing Emergency Room Efficiency: A Data-Driven Approach| Excel | Power BI 

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes **Emergency Room (ER) operational data** to uncover inefficiencies and recommend data-driven improvements. Built using **Excel** for data preparation and **Power BI** for dashboarding, the goal is to optimize **patient flow, wait times, and doctor performance** in a high-pressure hospital environment.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To transform raw ER data into clear, interactive dashboards that help hospital administrators:
- Identify bottlenecks in patient flow
- Analyze doctor performance and satisfaction impact
- Monitor triage-level wait times
- Make informed staffing and process decisions

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning & preparation
- **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX, and dashboard creation
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Custom KPIs and measures
- **Data Storytelling** – Business-driven layout and recommendations

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features
✔️ 4 Interactive Report Pages:
1. **Executive Summary** – KPIs, wait times, visit trends  
2. **Patient Flow & Triage Analysis** – Wait times by triage level, trends, heatmap  
3. **Doctor Efficiency & Satisfaction** – Box plots, satisfaction trends, doctor analysis  
4. **Analyst Summary & Recommendations** – Key insights + actionable suggestions

✔️ Advanced Features:
- Custom **KPI cards** and **dynamic slicers**
- **Drillthroughs**, **tooltips**, and **heatmaps**
- Insight boxes and recommendation cards with clear business value

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Wait times increase sharply during peak hours**, especially for less severe cases
- **Doctor experience doesn't correlate with satisfaction**, suggesting mentorship > seniority
- **Triage Level 3 patients** face the longest delays — opportunity to reprioritize

---

## ✅ Recommendations
- Launch a **Doctor Mentorship Program** to maintain satisfaction while scaling performance  
- Rebalance triage protocols to reduce unnecessary delays  
- Monitor peak hours more closely and adjust staffing levels dynamically
